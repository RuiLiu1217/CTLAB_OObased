The projection model that can be filled in the parameter of static function Proj/Back are:
  1. "Branchless DD"
  2. "Pseudo DD" (fastest and suggested)
  3. "Distance Driven"
There are also other parameters can be used ("Z Line" for backprojection, "Double Precision DD" for both Proj and Back)
But because there may be some issues, we do not suggest to use them if unnecessary.
